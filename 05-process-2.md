# The Process (in Sweden) part II

## Endo

Beginning of May I go to my second appointment at ANOVA, regarding my
blood test.  I meet an endocrinologist.  They open up a spreadsheet on
their computer, full of numbers, and go through it, telling what each
one of them means.  According to numbers I'm fine.  My hormone levels
are in the "normal" female range.  I tell the endo that my dosage
changed since the blood test (I went to 4mg of Estradiol instead of
2mg) and they say it should be fine as long as I feel well (I do, much
better actually).

My enzyme levels are fine too.  Vitamin D is a bit lower than expected
but nothing to worry about.

They also tell me it doesn't make any sense whatsoever to split the
dose of Cyproterone in two parts of 12.5mg each and take it morning
and evening.  Instead I should just take 25mg once a day.

I'm going to do another blood test any time after that, but I'm saving
it for after I change my dose a bit, because I want to lower Cypro
intake (to 12.5mg daily) and try out Progesterone.

If my next blood test shows something bad, they will contact me.

## No progress

End of May I go to my third appointment.  Apparently, it's a bit
"unrelated" to the whole process and the only thing that happens is
I'm being asked crapload of questions regarding my physical and mental
health.  Like, if I have depression, schizophrenia, ADHD, if I take
illegal drugs and so on.  I'm told it will take two or three
appointments more for the "team" to be able to draw a diagnosis.  I
will meet psychologist next, and then a social worker.

I guess it's two to three months more then.  And that's considered as
*quick*.  What the fucking fuck...
