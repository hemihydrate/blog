# Resources

The ones that helped me in one way or another. I'll try to keep the list as short as possible.

 * [The Transition Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfO3B57E6NpIn-KsVjvmLLw). Concise videos made by a gender specialist.
 * [Zinnia Jones](https://youtube.com/user/ZJemptv). She has many great videos there regarding gender. Her argumentation is very strong and is always based on a thorough research, never on rumors.
 * [transformering.se](http://transformering.se). Sweden-related resources on the topic. It has a well defined steps of the process in this specific country, too.
 * [reddit](http://reddit.com). There are several subreddits worth checking out. Just search for them.
 * [Am I transgender?](http://amitransgender.com). A site made specifically for those transgender people who are questioning. It answers the question.
