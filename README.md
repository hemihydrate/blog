This is a blog with personal experiences of a transgender AMAB person
that is now transitioning. I will be sharing my experiences from the
past and present, trying to give a picture of how things look to me,
what thoughts I have, and how the transition is going. Hopefully, someone
will find this useful. I certainly would, if only I had a chance to find
something like this years ago.
