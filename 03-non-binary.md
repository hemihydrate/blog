# Non-binary

Non-binary can mean many things.  But it's also about *not* feeling as
one of the most common genders, which are male or female, for the
entire life, 24/7.  Gender may fluctuate.  It might be somewhere in
the middle.  It can be outside just as well.  There are no limits.

Am I non-binary?  That's the question I started asking myself after
thinking of how I see myself as a woman.  Do I like being called a
woman?  Do I like expressing myself as one (according to cis and
social normativity)?

Now I'm not exactly sure anymore.  I don't want to be called a man,
that's for sure, and I'd like to have as many feminine features as
possible, but do I consider myself a "100% genuine woman" on the
gender spectrum?  No.

What am I then?  I have no answer to it yet.  Maybe it's just myself.
I still like she/her pronouns and people seeing me as a woman.
Inside, I think it's a bit more complicated.

I'll see how it goes and report here when things are more clear.
