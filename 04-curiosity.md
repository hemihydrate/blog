# Curiosity

People are curious. The ones that know I'm transgender, I mean.
Perhaps it's my own fault they are *too* curious sometimes.
I'm trying to be as open as possible, ask-me-anything kind of style.
In my opinion, sharing knowledge is crucial for people to *understand* the issue,
and what would be the best way other than talking to a walking issue at hand.
I get it, people are curious. That's totally fine.

What I don't like is when people view a transgender person as just that â€” a
*transgender*, not a *person*. I mean, being "transgender" does not *define*
a person. Could you ever imagine things a transgender person might be interested
in discussing about? You won't believe it, just the same things a non-transgender
person would be interested in! Wow.

Transgender people watch movies??? No way. I thought they just stare in the mirror all day, crying.

They read books? I thought they only read `r/asktransgender`.

They enjoy drawing or taking pictures of nature or people? I thought they just post timelines on imgur!!!

And so on. Imagine talking to a woman having kids only about the "mom stuff". So how are your children? How is it to be a mom? Are you going to get more children? Do they poo a lot? What do they eat?

Oh, and I actually like to know more about you. More than talk about myself.

I'm a person. Every transgender person is a *person* foremost. Please, don't view us as some
funny creatures you saw at the zoo.
