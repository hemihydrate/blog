# The Process (in Sweden) part II

## Endo

Beginning of May I go to my second appointment at ANOVA, regarding my
blood test.  I meet an endocrinologist.  They open up a table of their
computer, full of numbers, and go through it, telling what each of
them mean.  According to it, I'm fine.  My hormone levels are in
"normal" female range.  I tell them that my dosage changed since the
blood test (I went to 4mg of Estradiol instead of 2mg) and they say it
should be fine as long as I feel well (I do, much better actually).

My enzyme levels are fine too.  Vitamin D is a bit lower than expected
but nothing worrying at all.

They also tell me it doesn't make any sense whatsoever to split the
dose of Cyproterone into two parts of 12.5mg each and take it morning
and evening.  Instead I should just take 25mg once daily.

I'm going to do another blood test any time after that, but I'm saving
it for after I change my dose a bit, because I want to lower Cypro
intake (to 12.5mg daily) and try out Progesterone.

If my next blood test shows something bad, they will contact me.

## No progress

End of May I go to my third appointment.  Apparently, it's a bit
"unrelated" to the whole process and the only thing that happens is
I'm being asked crapload of questions regarding my physical and
psychological health.  Like, if I have depression, schizophrenia,
ADHD, if I take illegal drugs and so on.  I'm told it will take two or
three more appointments for the "team" to be able to draw a diagnosis,
and that I will meet psychologist and a social worker.

I guess it's two to three months more then.  And that's considered as
*quick*.  What the fucking fuck...
